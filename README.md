# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Project Description

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! In this project, we will be building the foundation for a full web application - an AirBnB clone. The first step involves creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This command interpreter will allow us to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects, as well as perform various operations on them.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a shell-like interface that enables the user to interact with the AirBnB objects. It supports commands such as creating new objects, retrieving objects from storage, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script in the terminal.
